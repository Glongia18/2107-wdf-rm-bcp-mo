// while loops and for loops are comparable. Although you can use while loops whenever you like, it's preferred that you use them in specific situations. See below for that situation

// when you know how many times you want to run the code before hand. usually str.length or array.length times or num times
for (let i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {}

// while setup
// use while when you don't know how many times you'll need to run the loop. Think BacteriaTime
let i = 0;
while (i < num.length) {
    i++;
}
